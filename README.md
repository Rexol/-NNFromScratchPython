# NNFromScratchPython
My realization of a simple dl framework from scratch

There are simple parts to build neural network:
 - Linear Layer
 - Activation Functions:
     - ReLU
     - LeakyReLU
     - Sigmoid
     - Softmax
 - Regularization Layers:
     - Dropout
     - Batchnorm (1 dimentional version)
 - Criterions:
     - MSE
     - CrossEntropy
     
The framework was tested on MNIST classification problem. And got accuracy score > 98% on test dataset
